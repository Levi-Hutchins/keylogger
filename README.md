# Key Logger
## Description
This is a project I developed to gain a deeper understanding on how and why key loggers work. This specific key logger is designed to take screenshots every 3 seconds when chrome is running and if the phrase "Log In" or "Sign In" is detected within those images it will begin logging key strokes. It is also designed to have a specific runtime which is defined in the main.py script; once the runtime is up the logger will then encrypt the log file and send it to the destination address.
