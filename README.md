# Key Logger
## Description
This was one of a series of projects I completed after finishing my first year of computer science. The project was designed to allow me to gain a deeper understanding of how and why keyloggers work. By developing these software tools and gaining an insider mindset I will hopefully now be able to know when and where a key logger might be in use and how to combat that.
